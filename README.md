Background Subtraction: This folder contains codes for subtracting the background from the initial interferometry data. The dataset should include a sufficient agar surface so that it can detect the agar and fit a best-fit polynomial for subtraction

interpolatImages: This folder contains code to interpolate images with nan. Interpolation is necessary to calculate the volume of the colony. Splines interpolation is implemented. Since the data are radially symmetrical, we start from the center of the colony and draw lines pointing radially outward to interpolate
